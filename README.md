# mhsParking-android
Android edition for MHS parking program.
The mhs parking pass project is our attempt to make the parking paras life much easier and keep our parking lots safe and accountable. The software uses a technology titled ALPR (Automated license plate reading) which is commonly used by things like speed cameras. We can use this tech to eliminate the time it takes for a para to look through a clipboard list of license plates and do the search automatically. the paras simply pull out an android device, tap a button, and it will read the license plate and return if it is a registered license plate or not.
